# Assistant-Zero: Pioneering the Future of Personal AI Assistants

The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal AI have revolutionized how we interact with technology. Tools like ChatGPT and Claude have become essential parts of our daily lives, powering intelligent assistants that help us stay productive and organized.

Currently, most personal AI assistants rely on cloud-based APIs to access large models due to the limitations in running massive models efficiently on devices. However, with the progress of open-source models like DeepSeek, Llama, and Qwen, combined with the development of AI hardware, we're getting closer to the day when personal AI assistants will fully support inference on-device.

The Assistant-Zero project aims to explore the technology stack behind the ultimate personal AI assistant. We are developing models and solutions based on our vision of the future of AI assistants, and we're inviting the community to join us as we pave the way toward the next generation of intelligent assistant products.
